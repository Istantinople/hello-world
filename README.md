Istantinople, Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering from Louisiana Tech University, working for a controls company in New Orleans. Looking to ditch that shit and do something worth while. Gonna be making stuff in KiCad and Python, as well as whatever I pick up along the way. Meanwhile I'm gonna get a PE liscense just cause.
